### **Predicting Red Wine Quality**


The wine industry is highly competitive and saturated with many different varieties and blends for the consumer to choose from. As such, many wine rating websites have popped up such as Wine Enthusiast and Vivino, which help customers separate the gems from the chaff. For a winery, itâ€™s important for them to invest in wines that are going to get high ratings so that they can recoup their investments.
This project will use Red Wine Quality Data Set, available on the UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality/winequality-red.csv  
to perform binary classification for wine quality using ML Algorithm.
